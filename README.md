# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
## Goals:
* Keep a grid that records all input that has occurred so far.

1. store a nested collection of lists in a variable titled "board".
2. all spaces should be " " to start
3. As user input is received, update the board to reflect input

* track if the game has been won/lost

1. 

* take user input in form of digit (1-9) and correspond each digit with a square on the board.

1. take user input and store in a variable
2. check if input is valid and re-prompt if it is not.
3. 

* Simple AI

1. import random
2. keep a list of numbers 1 - 9 and remove them as user/AI input moves.
3. use random.choice to select next AI move

### Future project: Smart AI:
if player has two in a row, AI will always block the win.
